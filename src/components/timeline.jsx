                        <p>Developed the Front-end UI in Angular 2 with HTML, CSS, and Javascript on a B2B platform tool. Providing front end enhancements to increase productivity and responsiveness for our CSRs.
                        This platform consumes API data from a Promotional items catalog that returns the necessary information allowing the CSRs to search for the products their customers are wanting to order. I developed the UI that populates this returned data making it accessible to the CSRs.
                        It also makes calls to our internal API to return account and billing information for the customers that are placing orders. Created the methods and services that returned this data and populated the UI.
                        This platform has increased productivity for CSRs so that they do not have to repeat processes to process orders thus delaying turn times for our customersâ€™ orders.
                        This platform automatically produces the Purchase orders for our vendors and also inserts the data into the billing system for them allowing the CSRs more time to process additional orders.
